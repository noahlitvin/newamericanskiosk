The **New Americans Kiosk** is a multilingual diagnostic tool that connects users to financial services and educational material.

Intended primarily for those undergoing the naturalization process in New York City, the interface is designed to make no assumptions regarding how deeply users understand their financial situation or the ways in which financial services operate in the United States. While engaging with the kiosk, users build an avatar as they answer simply phrased financial questions in their native language. Based on this information, they are directed to existing financial empowerment resources.
